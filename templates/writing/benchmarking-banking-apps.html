<p>In December 2014 and January 2015, I spent a few weeks investigating the usability of the latest generation of apps from UK retail banks, through a mixture of user observation, expert UX analysis, a NatRep survey and analysing app reviews. I wrote up what Iâ€™d learnt in a 2,000 word summary and a 20,000 word report, which the Adaptive Lab team used to increase our profile in the finance sector and start conversations with potential clients. Read the summary report.</p>
