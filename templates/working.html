<p>I've worked in product for around eight years, across a range of different sectors and company sizes/scales. As a product consultant, I've defined MVPs and product positioning new product offerings and pivots of existing products, across fintech, identity and media. Working in-house, I've managed significant parts of household name B2C products with millions of MAU, and niche B2B products with thousands of customers. I've worked or consulted for Skyscanner, Barclays, 11:FS, Experian, the Associated Press and Tesco â€“ as well as smaller companies like Small Improvements and Silicon Milkroundabout.</p>

<p>What unites all of these roles for me has been a fascination with complex, ambiguous problem domains, and a common approach to understanding and solving user problems. I believe the best products are based on the kind of deep and nuanced understanding of users that comes only from combining quantitative and qualitative insight. I think they're delivered in tight, iterative cycles of hypothesising, building the least possible, and learning from what you build. At the same time, I think you need to take the occasional bold leap if you're going to deliver the greatest possible impact.</p>

<p>From my experience, the magic ingredients for high performing product teams are <strong>alignment</strong> with business strategy and product vision; <strong>autonomy</strong> within a clearly defined domain; and <strong>accountability</strong> for customer/business outcomes and impacts on other teams. I believe the best products emerge from highly collaborative cross-functional teams where everyone has a stake in <i>what</i> is being built and a clear understanding of <i>why</i>, rather than just concerning themselves with <i>how</i> to deliver it. Nailing the processes and communication practices that help organisations succeed is an art more than a science, and one that will probably fascinate me til my grave.</p>
